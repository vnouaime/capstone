## Usage

Project is based on external API: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/wayfair. API only supplies images for products when searching. Other endpoints do not provide images. I have put a placeholder image for all the products when not searching for items. Users can signup to create their own profile and items to cart. Can place mock orders after reviewing details of order (Does not take real payment). Users can edit their own profile as well.
